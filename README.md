🌟 ShinyApp for Sensory and Statistical Analysis

Overview
The app offers an intuitive interface for importing data, performing advanced statistical analyses, and visualizing results interactively.

Key Features
Data Input and Visualization:
Load Excel files with sensory evaluation data.
Display and explore data tables interactively.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Generate correlation matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
Visualize variance explanations and create biplots for treatments and panelists.

ANOVA and Mean Comparison:
Perform ANOVA tests for selected attributes.
Conduct LSD tests for treatment mean comparisons.

Panelist Reproducibility:
Analyze panelist reproducibility across different treatments.

Interaction and Radial Charts:
Visualize treatment and panelist interactions.
Create dynamic radial charts for attribute evaluation across treatments.

Built With
R: Shiny, FactoMineR, factoextra, ggplot2, dplyr, highcharter, lattice, agricolae.
Data Visualization: Interactive charts and plots for better insights.
Statistical Analysis: Automated workflows for ANOVA, PCA, and more.

Usage
Data Preparation:
Ensure your sensory evaluation data is in an Excel file format.
Include the three first columns named as Panelista, Repetición, and Tratamiento in that order. Anyother colums will be treated as the attributes (no specific name requirements)

App Workflow:
Load your data using the file input. (only .xlsx file by now)
Select specific attributes for analysis.
Explore the results through the tabs for PCA, ANOVA, reproducibility, and more.
